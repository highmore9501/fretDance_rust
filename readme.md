### Note to English Readers:

Due to the extensive documentation content, I recommend viewing my Zhihu Column for complete information.

As the author is not a native English speaker, this README may contain machine-translated text. For better understanding, I suggest English readers:

1. Visit my Zhihu Column
2. Use browser translation plugins for optimal reading experience

The automatic translation from Chinese to English typically provides more accurate results than my direct machine translation here.

### About This Rewrite
